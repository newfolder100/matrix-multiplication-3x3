Matrix Multiplication (3×3)

This C++ program multiplies two 3×3 matrices entered by the user and prints the resulting matrix.

Features

Reads two 3×3 matrices from user input

Computes their product using nested loops

Prints the resulting matrix in a clean format

Example

Input (two 3×3 matrices):

Matrix A:           Matrix B:
1 2 3               9 8 7
4 5 6               6 5 4
7 8 9               3 2 1


Output (Matrix C = A × B):

30 24 18
84 69 54
138 114 90
